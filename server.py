# cl args listen port for udp, listen port for tcp

# realize when the whole file is transferred then stop listening, reassamble, save the files.

# calculate the average packet transmisson times for udp and tcp
# start the time before sending a packet in client. 
# stop the time after packet is recieved in server.
# If you resend a packet only consider the last packet.

#Print average as..
#TCP Packets Average Transmission Time: ... ms
#UDP Packets Average Transmission Time: ... ms
#TCP Communication Total Transmission Time: ... ms
#UDP Communication Total Transmission Time: ... ms


# in the client -> UDP Transmission Re-transferred Packets: ...
