I have started to do this homework in 12.12.2020. I decided to start with the TCP, since UDP requires RDT on top of it, i thought it would be easier to do after implementing TCP. 

I spent most of my time debugging the transferred file check. My program sends it as a binary but when I write it to the file, decoding and encoding method did not seem to work. I think my wrting was the issue, by adding "b" tag, I was able to solve the issue. I had the issue of getting corrupted chars when sending with tcp. 
I got '�����' these types of corrupt readings from TCP. These defects wasted good chunk of my time. But then I uncommented my time.sleep()
then those defects were gone. Running diff on two files gave finally no differences and the checksums matched. I have looked to socket.settimeout, but decided to implemented it later if I had time, because it did not work when adding intuitively.
